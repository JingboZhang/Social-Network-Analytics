Frequent contact among students themselves and students and teachers in elementary schools is critical for providing a personal and effective education. This report focus on the analysis of a contact network in one elementary school. The main finding of this project is about students’ behavior patterns. First, we find that the students in low grade tend to communicate more with others. But when they get older, they tend to stay in their own circle more. Second, students are found to lean to make friends with students in same class. Third, it’s relatively easy for students to form weak contact with heterosexual students. However, students tend to choose same-gender students as their close friends. Fourthly, students with close relationship may share 13 or more close friends together. In addition, we find that in this school, the communication between teachers and students is absolutely insufficient. Teachers may need to take corresponding action to improve this.
